## AsterLinux Release Cycle

AsterLinux is a rolling release distribution with some cyclical elements which are minor and major updates.

Minor updates will be released every 3 months and will integrate the previous months updates into a new ISO. A major update will be released every 12 months.

The current AsterLinux release is FX1 (Flagship XFCE4 Release 1) and the ISO build date is 01 June 2021.

The release number (1) won't change with minor updates; the ISO build date will change with each incremental release.

You can check the ISO build date by typing `iso` into a terminal.

Changelog for minor and major releases will be available here and on SourceForge.
