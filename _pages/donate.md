## The Origin of AsterLinux

Hi, my name is Imran and I'm the creator of AsterLinux.

Before asking for your support, I want to share a little story about the past, present and future of AsterLinux.

First of all the name; Aster is the name of my favourite flower.

AsterLinux started life as a hobby project but over the course of 8 months, countless sleepless nights and many energy drinks; has grown into something much bigger than I had ever anticipated.

I feel no shame in sharing there were many days and nights where I felt out of my depth and abandoning the project was a serious consideration.

However the decision to soldier on has come to fruition and the 1st of June 2021 is a momentous personal landmark.

## The Future of AsterLinux

Although I am very proud that AsterLinux has matured into a fully fledged operating system, I also understand the current development model is not sustainable.

Every passing year ushers in the release of many new Linux distributions, but unfortunately most are abandoned within months. The plan for AsterLinux is to avoid that fate and go much further.

Many developers have learned the hard way that releasing a distribution is relatively easy when compared to maintaining the project and adding new features on a timely basis.

I on my own can only take the project so far. Today I am wearing many hats; I am the developer, coder, maintainer, designer etc. It goes without saying that some hats fit better than others.
