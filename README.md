<h2 style="text-align: center;">Welcome to the AsterLinux Github Page</h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Below you will find more info about the AsterLinux project</h3>

AsterLinux is an Arch Linux based distribution that aims to cater for new and intermediate users. Although Arch Linux is popular with enthusiasts, the relative complexity of installing and configuring Arch Linux the "arch way" is daunting for many.

Arch Linux is also the gateway to cutting edge Linux development, and it's a shame so many people look elsewhere due to misinformation and poor advice.

Advice such as new users should stick to Ubuntu based distributions is echoed in a sheeple manner on many popular forums and social media. 

To clarify; this isn't a dig at Ubuntu, Linux Mint or even Zorin OS. There is nothing inherently wrong with any of them, indeed they all serve as a great introduction to the world of GNU/Linux.

However most of the advice found online is based on hearsay and stands without merit. In fact Arch Linux is a stable base and with the right Arch based distro, some tweaks and a little common sense, is just as easy to use as any "beginner friendly" distribution.

<h3 style="text-align: center;">The philosophy of the AsterLinux project</h3>

AsterLinux is an all inclusive distribution that doesn't take sides; this boils down to giving users a "beautifully" themed and tweaked xfce4 desktop that can be used by anyone in any way the user deems fit.

New users will appreciate the layout and the many ui enhancements; and we haven't forgotten about terminal centric power users either. Both the desktop and terminal have received a makeover with enhanced functionality added to both.
